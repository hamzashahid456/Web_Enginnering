        <h3>HTML</h3>
        <p>
            HTML is the standard language that is used for creating webpages and web applications. 
            Every time you access a website, a server sends an HTML file to your computer and your browser 
            interprets and displays the information included in that file. In fact, 
            all the information you are reading now is simply data that has been stored in an HTML file and sent to your browser.

        <h3>CSS</h3>
        <p>
            Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language 
            such as HTML or XML (including XML dialects such as SVG, MathML or XHTML).
            [1] CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.[2]
            CSS is designed to enable the separation of content and presentation, 
            including layout, colors, and fonts.[3] This separation can improve content accessibility; 
            provide more flexibility and control in the specification of presentation characteristics; 
            enable multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file, 
            which reduces complexity and repetition in the structural content; 
            and enable the .css file to be cached to improve the page load speed between the pages that share the file and its formatting.
